Never wander like a library goose again

This is our Library Seat Checking app, LibCheck for short. It allows you to search, book, navigate to, and check into seats in advance.

The AR component is build with ARKit, and it helps users navigate to their seat. It uses AR Markers on the group, to allow Bulba to "walk."
